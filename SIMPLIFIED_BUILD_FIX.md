# Simplified Build Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The build was failing because Node.js and npm were not available in the build environment when the override-build script was running. The error was:

```
/tmp/tmpfuebxczz/scriptlet.sh: line 15: node: command not found
/tmp/tmpfuebxczz/scriptlet.sh: line 16: npm: command not found
```

## Root Cause

The npm plugin sets up Node.js, but our override-build script was trying to use Node.js before the plugin had a chance to install it.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Simplified Architecture**
- **Removed**: Separate electron and nodejs parts
- **Kept**: Single `kesty-whatsapp` part using npm plugin
- **Approach**: Let npm plugin handle Node.js setup, then download Electron manually

### 2. **Fixed Build Process**
```yaml
override-build: |
  # Set environment variables first
  export ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1
  
  # Download Electron binary manually before npm install
  # (Download logic here)
  
  # Run default npm plugin behavior (installs Node.js + dependencies)
  craftctl default
  
  # Replace any downloaded Electron with our pre-downloaded version
  # (Replacement logic here)
```

### 3. **Key Changes Made**

#### Updated Node.js Version
- **From**: 18.19.0
- **To**: 20.18.0 (LTS)

#### Simplified Dependencies
- **Removed**: Complex multi-part setup
- **Added**: Essential build packages (wget, unzip, curl)
- **Kept**: All runtime stage-packages

#### Fixed Build Order
1. **Pre-download Electron** - Before npm install
2. **Run npm plugin** - Installs Node.js and dependencies
3. **Replace Electron** - Use our pre-downloaded version

### 4. **Configuration Summary**

```yaml
parts:
  kesty-whatsapp:
    plugin: npm
    source: .
    npm-include-node: true
    npm-node-version: "20.18.0"
    build-packages:
      - build-essential
      - wget
      - unzip
      - curl
      - ca-certificates
    override-build: |
      # Download Electron first, then run npm plugin
```

## Expected Results

This simplified approach should:

1. ✅ **Avoid Node.js not found errors** - npm plugin handles Node.js setup
2. ✅ **Prevent Electron download issues** - Pre-download before npm install
3. ✅ **Maintain architecture support** - All 5 architectures supported
4. ✅ **Reduce complexity** - Single part instead of multiple parts
5. ✅ **Improve reliability** - Standard npm plugin behavior

## Testing

The configuration has been validated:

```bash
npm run validate-build
# ✅ All validations passed!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit changes** to GitHub
2. **Trigger build** from Snapcraft dashboard
3. **Monitor build logs** for the new simplified process
4. **Test resulting snap** on target architectures

## Fallback Plan

If this simplified approach still has issues, we can:

1. Use the alternative snapcraft configuration: `snap/snapcraft-alternative.yaml`
2. Build only for amd64 initially to test the process
3. Add architectures incrementally once the base build works

The simplified configuration prioritizes reliability over complexity and should resolve the Node.js availability issue.
